# Machine-Learning-Techniques-Analysis
The main goal of this project is to analyze and criticize the performance of
some classification techniques, including decision tree, Random Forest, SVM, k nearest neighbor (KNN), Bagging,
AdaBoost, Multilayer Neural Networks, and Naive Bayesian Classification. To compare the performance of these
algorithms, six data sets selected from UCI Machine Learning Repository. They consist of different attribute
characteristics including integer, real, and categorical. Outcome: analyze the performance of these classification
techniques based on the value of F-measure.
